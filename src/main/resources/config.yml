# SpecialItem Plugin Configuration

# Strict mode:
# true: When a player uses an item, its properties (commands, cooldown, etc.)
#       are ALWAYS read from this file based on its internal ID.
#       This ensures consistency, even if the item was modified.
# false: When a player uses an item, its properties are first read from the
#        item's own data (PDC). If a property is missing, it falls back
#        to this configuration file. This allows for "legacy" or uniquely
#        modified items to exist.
strict: false

# List of all special items. The key (e.g., 'fire_sword') is the unique ID for the item.
